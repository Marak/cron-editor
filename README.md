The cron format supports seconds. If your cron editor doesn't support seconds you can ignore this parameters.


<h3>Example Code</h3>

``` js
// be sure to include all required files ( see index.html file )
$(document).ready(function(){
  // turn the div into a cron editor
  $('.myDiv').croneditor({
    value: "* * * * * *"
  });
});
```
